# Meetup membership data without paying for the Meetup API.

Once upon a time, access to the meetup API was free. Now it requires a "Pro" license. Fortunately a regular meetup organizer can download a .csv file with some details about a group's membership.

This repo shows how to generate a few summaries from the Meetup .csv file and to get more detail about the other groups that current members are part of.
